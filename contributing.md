Thank you for considering a contribution to TensorSensor.  I welcome updates to the examples, README, or the source code itself.

Before you spend a lot of time creating a pull request (PR) for a new feature or a biggish change to the software, please contact me by email parrt@cs.usfca.edu  to find out if it's something I'm interested in.  One of the hardest things to do, as I've learned over the last 30 years pushing out open-source software, is to maintain project focus and conceptual integrity.
